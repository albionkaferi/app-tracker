# App Tracker

App Tracker is a desktop application designed to empower users to take control of their screen time by setting limits on applications and automatically terminating them once those limits are reached.

## Features

- **Application Time Limits:** You can easily set limits on how much time you spend on specific applications. 

- **Automatic Termination:** When an application's set time limit is reached, App Tracker will automatically terminate the application. 

- **System Tray Functionality:** App Tracker will run in the system tray, allowing tracking to seamlessly occur in the background.
## In Progress

- **Improved Backend Efficiency**

- **Ability To Track Screen Time**
